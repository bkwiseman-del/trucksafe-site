TRUCKSAFE MIGRATION AUDIT
Wix to Next.js — Complete URL Inventory & Status Report
Source: live trucksafe.com sitemap data | Version 4.0 | February 2026

Legend
Symbol

Meaning

Built

Route already exists in Next.js repo

Must Build

Wix page exists with no matching Next.js route

Redirect

Wix URL needs a 301 redirect to a different Next.js URL

Clarify

Exists on both platforms — purpose needs confirmation

Exclude

Wix draft or copy page — do not migrate

1. Critical Issues — Fix Before Launch
1.1 Blog Post URL Mismatch (SHOWSTOPPER)
All 206 Wix blog posts live at /post/[slug]. The Next.js repo has NO /post/ route — only
/articles/[slug]. Without action, every article URL becomes a 404 on launch day.
Option

Approach

SEO Impact

A
(Recommended)

Build app/post/[slug]/page.tsx — preserve Wix URLs
as canonical

Zero — no redirects, no crawl delay,
full SEO preserved

B (Acceptable)

Add 301 redirects: /post/:slug -> /articles/:slug in
next.config.js

Minor — redirects pass ~99% link
equity but add latency

C (Avoid)

Do nothing

CATASTROPHIC — 206 pages
become 404s, all SEO value lost

WARNING: Option A is strongly recommended. Preserving /post/[slug] means zero redirects and zero
SEO risk.

1.2 drug/alcohol-testing Category Slug Has a Literal Forward Slash
The Wix blog category URL is: /blog/categories/drug/alcohol-testing. The forward slash is part of
the slug, causing Next.js to interpret it as two nested route segments. This must be handled with
an explicit redirect before any general :cat wildcard rule.
Wix URL

Problem

Fix

/blog/categories/drug/alcoholtesting

Slash in slug breaks Next.js
routing

Redirect to /articles/categories/drugalcohol-testing — place BEFORE general
:cat rule

1.3 trucksafeconsulting.com Domain Redirect
The old domain trucksafeconsulting.com has indexed /post/[slug] URLs in Google. These links
will 404 after migration unless a domain-level 301 redirect is configured from
trucksafeconsulting.com to trucksafe.com at the DNS/hosting level.

4. Store Products — Complete Inventory
Source: trucksafe.com/store-products-sitemap.xml — 24 products at /product-page/[slug].
The Next.js repo has a /shop route but no product detail pages. Decision needed: build native
shop, redirect to external store, or keep Wix store temporarily.

Order matters: specific rules must come before general wildcard rules.
async redirects() {
return [
// drug/alcohol MUST come before general :cat rule

destination:
'/articles/categories/drug-alcohol-testing',
permanent: true,
},
{ source:
'/blog', destination: '/articles', permanent: true },
{ source:
'/blog/categories/:cat', destination: '/articles/categories/:cat', permanent: true },
